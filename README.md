## A method for studying structural variants (SVs) in chromosome sequences

Chromosome architecture has played a key role in the evolution of biodiversity. Structural comparisons of chromosomes have informed the study of supergenes, sex chromosomes, and some of the earliest divergences in the tree of life. **Structural Disparity Analysis** is a computationally non-intensive approach, based on geometric morphometrics, that captures disparity scores across conserved chromosomal regions using single-copy, conserved genomic regions as landmarks (e.g. benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs [BUSCO] and ultraconserved elements [UCEs]). The method allows users to visualize SVs in multivariate space using PCA for many species or individuals at the same time.
